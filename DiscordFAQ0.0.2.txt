**Q: What is ldn_mitm? How do i use it? **
A: ldn_mitm is a sysmodule for CFW Users which prevents to use the normal Local Multiplayer Mode. Instead of that were now able to use this Mode as a "Online" Multiplayer!
Some Outdated but still good Infos can find here about ldn_mitm and SLP: https://gbatemp.net/threads/ldn_mitm-play-local-wireless-supported-games-online.525512/

**Q: What is SLP? (Switch-Lan-Play)? **
A: The release of switch-lan-play opened doors previously closed, allowing us to play a select list of games online regardless of bans and subscriptions.

**Q: Do i need Nintendo Online or are you from Nintendo?**
A: Short Answer: No.
Long Answer: No, the only thing you need is to follow the Instructions under this Message and youre ready to go.
You are banned and still want to play certain Games with your Friends? You're more than Welcome here. 

**Q: What is the difference between your SLP and the Real Online Mode?**
A: For the Real Online Mode you would need a Legit Switch that is currently not banned and Unmodified (to not get banned). It uses the Official Nintendo Servers to Communicate with each other.
We're using our own programmed Server Software by <@!379967147167842304> in connection with the sysmodule ldn_mitm which allows us to let OFW/CFW/unbanned/banned Players to play together on the Servers.
The Difference is now that were not using the Normal Online Mode, were "ab"using the Local Multiplayer Feature which allows us to connect to the Selfmade Servers so you can enjoy Playing. 
And this Time with Really the Entire World. ;)

If you want one because there is no Reachable in your near, you can guarantee a stable Internet Connection and a stable Uptime then you should take a look under #public-servers

**Q: (Windows Client) I'm getting a [DEBUG]: 1wip-> onClose error**

You'll find a List of Available Games under #game-list
